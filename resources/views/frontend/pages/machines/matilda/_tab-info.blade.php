            <h4>3D Touch</h4>
            <p>
                The original iPhone introduced the world to Multi-Touch, forever changing the way people experience technology. With 3D Touch, you can do things that were never possible before. It senses how deeply you press the display, letting you do all kinds of essential things more quickly and simply. And it gives you real-time feedback in the form of subtle taps from the all-new Taptic Engine.

                The 12-megapixel iSight camera captures sharp, detailed photos. It takes brilliant 4K video, up to four times the resolution of 1080p HD video. iPhone 6s also takes selfies worthy of a self-portrait with the new 5-megapixel FaceTime HD camera. And it introduces Live Photos, a new way to relive your favorite memories. It captures the moments just before and after your picture and sets it in motion with just the press of a finger.

                Innovation isn’t always obvious to the eye, but look a little closer at iPhone 6s and you’ll find it’s been fundamentally improved. The enclosure is made from a new alloy of 7000 Series aluminum — the same grade used in the aerospace industry. The cover glass is the strongest, most durable glass used in any smartphone. And a new rose gold finish joins space gray, silver, and gold.
